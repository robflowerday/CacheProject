- As the task stated that each value had a unique key, I have not implemented
    any behaviour should an item be added to the cache with the same key as
    an item in the cache, but a different value. If this were to be handled,
    I imagine the desired behaviour would be to update the value of the item
    in the cache with the exosting key. Under normal circumstances, I would
    have established this by clarifying during the planing phase of the work.
- Another clarification I would have made was around the generic type aspect
    of the cache, I have created a cache using a doubly linked list and a
    dictionary. Because of this, when using the cache, you can instantiate
    it with any generic type for the key or value, but all future values must
    be the same as these types. I could see this being usedul in FinBourne
    for situations like caching regularly traded asset prices or calculation
    results based off their price. If the intended behaviour was that any
    type should have been allowed for the keys and values of the cache and
    that these types are subject to change within the same cache, a hashTable
    would have been a more appropriate replacement data structure than a
    dictionary.
      It's my understanding that these are very similar in C# and that C#
    actually creates it's dictionary object based off a hash table, the
    differences being type safety, meaning that an error will be thrown if
    you don't use the key and value types that you are required to specify on
    use (with performance benefits because of this for the dictionary due to
    the boxing and unboxing needed to hold the type of the key and the value
    in the HashTable).
